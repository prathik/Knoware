			<p>Get better ideas, review your thoughts and keep track of what is important. One of the most important things about life and progress is that you remember what is right and what is wrong.</p>

			<p><strong>KnoWare</strong> lets you efficiently track your thoughts. One thing you can notice is that there is no deleting ideas you can either approve them after review or reject them, the simple reason for this is once you get a thought in your mind,  you cannot undo it and similarly once you key in your thoughts here, you can either approve them or reject them. This makes sure that you never forget them.</p>

			<p>In this tool, you can never directly approve a thought, you have to wait for the required review period that is decided by you and then approve or reject it after the said period. Currently when you add the thought it is added in the review state but you can approve or reject it anytime, but this system is going to be changed soon.</p>

			<p>This tool also reminds you about the pending review after the review time is over and the reminder can be configured to come over email and by the next year feature to send SMS to your phone, remind you on Facebook will also come.</p>

			<h3>Example of using KnoWare</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>If you have an exam, you will make a study plan. Put that study plan on KnoWare and put the review time for 1 Week, check if you are meeting your goals with that study plan. If you are meeting your goals then approve the study plan and if you are not then reject it.</li>
